## About this app

This is a single page React app created to showcase a fine-dining restarant with sections for:

- About Us / History
- Beer, Wine and Cocktail list
- A chefs word and photo
- An embedded video with play/pause functionality
- Recognitions & Awards
- An image gallery
- Address, Opening Hours and Newsletter subscription

The app was created using React, Node.js, HTML and CSS initially following the Javascript Mastery walkthrough.

There are features such as image and video overlays, an embedded video shwocasing the dining setting, a black and gold theme throughout as well as full mobile compatibility.

There are additional features such as registration, table booking and the ability to view menu which I aim to implement moving forwards to expand the app.
